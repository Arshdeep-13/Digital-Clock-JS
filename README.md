# Digital-Clock-JS
Hello guys, I have created a digital clock using JavaScript which involves a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with an understanding of the Date object and basic programming concepts like functions and loops. With these tools and skills, you can create a digital clock that accurately displays the current time in a format that is easy to read and understand.

This GitHub repository contains the source code and related files for a digital clock created using JavaScript. The clock is designed to display the current time in a digital format, including hours, minutes, seconds, and an AM/PM indicator.

The clock is built using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is designed to be easily customizable and integrated into a variety of web applications and projects. The clock's appearance and behavior can be customized using CSS, and the clock's functionality can be extended using JavaScript.

The repository includes all of the necessary files to run the clock on a web page, including the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, as well as any required libraries or dependencies. The clock is fully responsive and can be displayed on a variety of screen sizes and devices.

The repository also includes detailed documentation and instructions for setting up and customizing the clock, making it easy for developers to incorporate the clock into their own projects. Additionally, the repository includes a number of examples and demos showcasing different configurations and use cases for the clock.
